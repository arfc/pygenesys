Welcome to PyGenesys's documentation!
=====================================
This package can be used to generate input files for the 
`Temoa`_ modelling tool. 
Transparency and repeatability are integral to the design 
motivations for Temoa. PyGenesys takes this concept
even further by reducing the lead time and programming 
background required to run Temoa.

PyGenesys offers technology models with cost and production 
time series data. The basic model is based on the state of 
Illinois and its flagship university, the University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
